# CodingTest-Backend

You have just received this source from a junior colleague and it is your responsibility to do a code review. The code is the base to what will become a large scale solution.

What we want you to do:
- Download a copy of the source and perform your code review. Put you comments within the source files or add them to a separate document, whichever is easiest for you.
- On another copy of the source, rework the source based on your code review feedback.
- Make sure that the code works/runs as expected.
- When done, email us a zip file containing the two folders of source from above to jobs@finovertech.com
